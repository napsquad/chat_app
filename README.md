# chat_app

Chatapp, used to send and recieve messages via tcp, later modifications
needed in order to fully realize potential of virtual closet.

to do:

	login functionality [x]
	make buttons visible post initialize[x](fixed by removing color)
	implement db structure(possibly sql/mongo) to hold pics[]
	implement popup Trade window[x]
		-get input from said window[]
		-store input from said window in DB (offsite)?

	possibly allow users to enter the IP that they wish to connect to
	via the "join" button" []

	
	implement user accounts[]
		-full logons or just setting names?[]
		- verify users?[]
		
	find how to run a persistent server[x]( while(true) does the trick )
	
bonus:
	profile pictures[]
	sales announcements(i have a scraper that we could use maybe)[]
		- nowhere to currently put sales window, could be a different
		tab once shipped to mobile
